                Hi, I&apos;m <span className="text-red-600 dark:text-red-500 font-medium">Nilesh Jaiswar</span>, a Full Stack Engineer with over two years of experience, mostly in the EdTech, digital media, and real estate sectors.

                My journey into web development started back in 2020 when I was a Computer Science student. A couple of friends and I got together to brainstorm project ideas, and we initially thought about creating a movie downloading website. We didn&apos;t end up pursuing that idea, but it was the spark that ignited my passion for web development.

                With a bit of HTML and CSS knowledge from junior college, I decided to dive deeper into the MERN stackâ€”MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. After a lot of learning and experimenting, I built my first website. That initial project might not have taken off, but it was a huge learning experience that gave me the practical skills I needed to move forward.

                Over the course of my career, I&apos;ve had the chance to work with a variety of companies, from EdTech startups like <a className="text-red-600 dark:text-red-500 hover:underline" href="https://maukaeducation.com/">Mauka Education</a> to real estate platforms such as PropertyLoop. I&apos;ve been involved in both front-end and back-end development, always striving to deliver high-quality, scalable solutions that help businesses grow.
